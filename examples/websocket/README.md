# Websocket

This code provides an example on how to connect to the websocket with a library that does not support authorization
header in the initial upgrade request. Once connected this code shows how to manage websocket messages. The list of
events can be found in the events section of each module on
the [coldwave documentation page](https://doc.coldwave.io/backend/v4/guides/introduction/).
